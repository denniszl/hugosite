Studying any language is difficult and it only feels worse because the more I learn the more I feel like I have to learn (at least in my case). Learning any language feels like swimming through an ocean. Even if you know you're making progress, when it feels like you're wading through something endless, progress seems meaningless to measure. That's why it's good to have goalposts every once in a while.

The [JLPT](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/) is a fairly arbitrary exam that tests comprehension of Japanese. Like any kind of certification or degree, it is a piece of paper that says _some_ things, but doesn't tell the whole story (for example, the JLPT doesn't test speaking at all)! However, one useful aspect of the JLPT (or anything else with some kind of coursework), is that you're expected to know and understand a certain level of Japanese.

With this in mind, I've registered for the 2019 JLPT N2 exam on December 1st, 2019. The N2 is the second highest level of the exam, and it seems like most recruiters looking for people who can speak/understand Japanese are looking for either N2 (at minimum), or N2 equivalent. Passing the N2 requires getting at least 33% in every section and 50% overall on the exam. ([source](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/guideline/results.html))

There are many resources you can use to study, but I found this one: https://japanesetest4you.com. I've been measuring my progress using a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_O3tLI4qUrWMIUDlzB_AW2ImUT7elBFYtYjmw7qn5Gc/edit?usp=sharing). Based on the scores I've been getting taking sample tests, I think I'm in a good position to pass already, but I don't think my Japanese is particularly good so I'll be aiming to get closer and closer to 100% in all sections, especially grammar, which I appear to be struggling with.

In a later post I'll go over the tools I'm using to incorporate things like [spaced repitition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) into my memorization.
