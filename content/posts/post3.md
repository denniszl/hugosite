This post is a few months (okay, almost a year), late. I got my JLPT N2 certification!

Here are the tools I used to get to this point, and that I'm still using to this day to keep my Japanese skills somewhat sharp (does N2 mean I'm good at Japanese? I certainly think I have a long way to go).

Probably the least important of the two primary tools I used was the very famous [Wanikani](https://www.wanikani.com/).
My level on Wanikani at time of writing is 35. I would say around the level 30s I was starting to pick up new kanji, but for the most part it seems like most of the stuff I was learning at that point I had seen before. It's starting to become a good resource, but at the time I don't think it was that helpful since it was mostly kanji and vocabulary I had seen before. Still, it's a good tool to keep you studying everyday.

I think the _more_ important tool I used was [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), along with Ankiconnect and [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/). These tools were really important because they let me, find kanji I didn't recognize while I was browsing the internet. I'd then immediately add them to Anki and I'd be able to memorize them (eventually) using the SRS flashcards. The most important things when learning a language are immersion and consistency. The immersion part is pretty easy to figure out - there's a ton of Japanese culture you can experience online, chances are if you're already at the N3 or the N2 level you're probably there because of Japanese culture. The next piece, then is consistency. These tools allow you to be consistent on tackling vocabulary that you haven't seen before, and I believe this is the tool that will help me reach the level I want to be at.

I'll try and aim for N1. One day. That seems like a much more difficult mountain to climb.
